  - Awesome job Min!
  - Your mom just put the donuts in the oven. Mmmm, I can smell them now!
  - When they're done baking, we'll put them on display at the booth!
  - You've helped us out so much today, I think you deserve some time off.
  - Go on out there and talk to the other booths!
  - Maybe keep an eye out for something cool!

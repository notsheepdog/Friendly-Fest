  sentences:
  - Welcome little one!
  - You are about 2.5 seconds late to this meeting but I will forgive you.
  - ...just this once.
  - Now, come to my desk so you can sign the paper.
  - Once that is done the banner is yours.
  - Try to take 2.5 less than I alloted to this meeting, so I can remain on schedule.

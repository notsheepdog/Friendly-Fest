# Bloom, Min!
A exploration puzzle game where you play as Min, a tiny axolotl as he helps his family set up their donut booth for the yearly festival. Discover
a dream like world with bright colors and strange characters and finish minigames to complete your task

## Why'd we make this?
Bloom, Min! was made by a team of 4 students as a part of our Game Programming course. We designed, planned, ande developed this game in a 3 month 
time period using Unity. We aimed to create a nostalgic feeling game that users could play to unwind or distract themselves from a stressful day.

## What'd we learn?
- writing in progress -
